## Files

- **init.sql**: This file contains SQL scripts for initializing the PostgreSQL database, including the creation of tables for graph objects and relations.

## Usage

## Notes

Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running and that you have the necessary permissions to create databases and tables.
